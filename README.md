# Task_Tracker_Approcks
Technical Task to be submitted to Approcks company for assessment to join their developers team as a junior Web Developer!

I have completed this part from the project within a deadline of 7 days without having any guidlines for design just the requirements:
1- The Front-End layout side using, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. (for about 70% of app requirements)
2- The Front-End functionality side Using, JavaScript, Ajax, and jQuery. (for about 40% of app requirements)
3- The Back-End and logic and storage, using PHP, mySQL, in the traditional procedural way. (for about 40% of app requirements)

So this project still not finished, and I am not planing to finish it soon!
